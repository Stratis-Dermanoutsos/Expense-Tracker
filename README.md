# Expense-Tracker


### Idea
Create a simple interface you can use to add and categorize your expenses. Generate monthly reports based on the inputs and write custom alerts for things, like, “spending too much money on coffee… as always.”


### TO-DO list
  - [ ] Decide on what framework to use - WPF for native, ASP.NET for web, Xamarin for mobile
  - [ ] Save the info of each expense
  - [ ] Have many sorting options when displaying the expenses


##### DB Example
| Name | Cost | Day | Date | Category | Hour | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Coffee | 1.6 | Monday | 8/2 | Drink | Morning |
| Gas | 20 | Sunday | 31/1 | Car | Evening |
