# Expense-Tracker


### Idea
Create a simple interface you can use to add and categorize your expenses. Generate monthly reports based on the inputs and write custom alerts for things, like, “spending too much money on coffee… as always.”


### TO-DO list
  - [x] Decide on what framework/library to use - WPF for native, ASP.NET for web, Xamarin for mobile (chose WPF)
  - [ ] Create responsive UI
  - [ ] Save the info of each expense
  - [ ] Create the database for the user automatically
  - [ ] Have many sorting options when displaying the expenses


##### DB Example
| Name | Cost | Day | Date | Category | Hour | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Coffee | 1.6 | Monday | 8/2 | Drink | Morning |
| Gas | 20 | Sunday | 31/1 | Car | Evening |
